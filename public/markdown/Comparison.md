# <center>Live Chat: Standard Software Features</center>

Knowing what’s commonly available from live chat programs makes it easier to differentiate one option from another.

To that end, here are some common features you’ll find across most live chat software programs:

- The ability to customize the appearance of your live chat window to your company’s branding.
- The ability to set “office hours,” during which you have live agents available to chat (vs. a lead capture window that allows visitors to send you their questions for a future response).
- Triggered display, which makes it possible to display your chat window only on certain pages or in response to certain visitor actions.
- Basic lead capture capabilities.
- Chat history and basic chat analytics.

As a note, although these features are available on live chat programs, the extent to which they’re implemented may vary across free and paid plans. Chat history, for example, might be limited to just a few days or weeks on free plans, while longer histories of up to a year may be available by upgrading to the same program’s paid plan.
